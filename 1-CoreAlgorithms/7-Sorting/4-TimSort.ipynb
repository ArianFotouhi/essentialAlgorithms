    "# 🧠 TimSort – The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort an array efficiently in real-world scenarios by combining the strengths of:\n",
    "- **Insertion Sort** (fast on small or nearly sorted data)\n",
    "- **Merge Sort** (efficient and stable on larger data)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ TimSort is the default sorting algorithm in:\n",
    "- Python (`sorted()` and `.sort()`)\n",
    "- Java (for objects)\n",
    "- Android SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Break the array into **small runs** (slices of the array that are already sorted or nearly sorted).\n",
    "2. **Use Insertion Sort** on small runs to sort them efficiently.\n",
    "3. **Merge the runs** using a modified version of Merge Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ Real-world data often has order or partial sorting already. TimSort is optimized to detect and exploit that.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Code Structure (Simplified)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a basic implementation, we simulate TimSort with:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `insertion_sort(arr, left, right)`\n",
    "- Sorts a small subarray (called a **run**) in-place using Insertion Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `merge(arr, l, m, r)`\n",
    "- Merges two sorted subarrays: `arr[l..m]` and `arr[m+1..r]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `tim_sort(arr)`\n",
    "- Splits array into runs of size `RUN` (e.g. 32).\n",
    "- Applies insertion sort to each run.\n",
    "- Merges runs together repeatedly until the whole array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
