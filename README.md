## üìö Structure

This repository is organized by topic and technique, each with concise explanations and hands-on Jupyter Notebooks:

- **1-CoreAlgorithms/**
  - Two Pointers
  - Sliding Window
  - Binary Search
  - Prefix Sum
  - Difference Array
  - Hashing
  - Sorting (Merge, Quick, Heap, TimSort)
- **2-Recursion/**
  - Recursion Patterns
  - Backtracking
- **3-Trees&Graphs/**
  - DFS (Depth-First Search)
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - Union Find (Disjoint Set Union)
  - Topological Sort
  - Graph Traversal
- **4-DynamicProgramming/**
  - Classic DP Patterns (e.g., 0/1 Knapsack)

Each subfolder contains:
- **Jupyter Notebooks** with step-by-step solutions, annotated code, and visual walkthroughs.
- **Mini-README files** summarizing patterns, use-cases, and tips.
- **LeetCode-style examples for each subject:**  
  For every major algorithmic category (e.g., Trees, Graphs, DP), you‚Äôll find several LeetCode problems.  
  - **Each example includes:**  
    - **Base code** for hands-on learning  
    - **Verbose solutions** that shows and track the state of variables at each iteration, helping you deeply understand the algorithm‚Äôs flow

## üèÜ Who Is This For?

- **Interview Prep:** Practice the most common and high-yield patterns for FAANG and top tech interviews.
- **Students:** Build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.
- **Self-learners:** Quickly review and master essential techniques.

## üß≠ How to Use

1. **Pick a topic** (e.g., Sliding Window, DFS).
2. **Read the summary** in the topic's README.
3. **Work through the notebooks**‚Äîtry to solve problems before reviewing solutions.
4. **Review patterns** and revisit tricky problems regularly.

## üß© Key Patterns Covered

- Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search
- Prefix Sums, Difference Arrays
- Sorting: Merge, Quick, Heap, TimSort
- Recursion & Backtracking
- DFS, BFS, Union Find, Topological Sort, Graph Traversal
- Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Subset Sum, etc.)

## üí° Tips for Success

- **Master patterns, not just problems.** Most interview questions are variations on classic techniques.
- **Practice writing code by hand** (or on a whiteboard) to simulate interview conditions.
- **Understand time and space complexity** for each approach.
- **Review edge cases** and test your solutions thoroughly.
