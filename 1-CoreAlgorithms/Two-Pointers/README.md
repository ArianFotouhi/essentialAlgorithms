# ðŸ§­ Two Pointers Technique 

The **Two Pointers** technique is a powerful and elegant method to solve many problems efficiently â€” especially in arrays and strings. It's a staple in LeetCode, interviews, and competitive programming.

## ðŸ“Œ What is the Two Pointers Technique?

Two pointers are simply **two variables** (usually indices) that move through the data structure (like an array or string). These pointers can move **toward each other**, **in the same direction**, or **at different speeds**, depending on the problem.

## âš¡ Why Use Two Pointers?

- **Avoid nested loops** â†’ Reduce time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n)
- **Efficient in-place operations** â†’ Like modifying the array without extra space
- **Simplifies logic** in problems involving sorting, partitioning, or symmetry

---

## ðŸŽ¯ When to Think of Two Pointers?

Consider Two Pointers when:

- You're dealing with a **sorted array**
- You need to **search for a pair** that meets a condition (sum, difference, etc.)
- You're checking **symmetry** (e.g., palindromes)
- You're **removing duplicates** or **reordering** arrays in-place
- You're solving **sliding window** problems or working with **ranges**

## ðŸ§  Common Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `Left â†” Right` | Pointers from both ends moving inward | Palindromes, Two Sum II, Container With Most Water |
| `Slow + Fast` | One pointer chases another | Cycle detection, remove duplicates |
| `Start â†’ End` | Both move forward under conditions | Sliding window, merging arrays |

## ðŸ“˜ Summary

- âœ… **Two Pointers** is one of the simplest yet most powerful problem-solving techniques.
- âœ… Ideal when you need **O(n)** solutions for problems involving **pairs**, **subarrays**, or **reordering**.
- âœ… Watch for common patterns:  
  - `left â†” right` (opposite ends)  
  - `slow + fast` (chasing)  
  - `start â†’ end` (same direction)

> âœ¨ Mastering Two Pointers will give you an edge in cracking many "medium" level problems with ease.
